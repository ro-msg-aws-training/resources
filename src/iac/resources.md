# Resources

This is the only mandatory type for a CloudFormation template. As the name says, **resources** describe the infrastructure resources that will be provisioned, such as VMs (EC2 instances), networks (VPCs), security groups, databases and many more (the complete list can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html)).
