:::

## Who is this for?

This training is aimed for anyone working or looking to start working with AWS (or even cloud in general). It tackles beginner and intermmediat topics and it links to other curated resources that provide deeper explanations.

## Working Mode

One of the most important factors when working with AWS is knowing what can be done and which services to choose. We will go through the most commonly used services and get a feeling how and when to use them. For some of the topics you will be asked to do some extra research on your own in order to answer certain questions (designed to ease the understanding process). Moreover, we will go through some hands-on exercises and tutorials.

This training is not intended to be standalone. It acts as a hub of resources while providing certain explanations and use-cases based on our experience.

Since the training targets a wide range of developers and architects, you will see that the training spans 3 levels (the levels are based on both complexity and time required):

- **100** - Introductory explanations (e.g. networking concepts) and use-cases
- **200** - Slightly deeper explanations and certain features
- **300** - Longer tutorials and highly detailed topics. Go through them if the service is crucial for your system and/or are curious.

These are intended mostly to provide guidance based on what you are looking to understand and/or your actual project requires. For example, if your project follows a standard client-server architecture, you should be fine going up to 200 (inclusive). However, if your project has a large team with various features that requires some deep thinking and understanding, you should go for the whole training and linked resources.

If no level is specified, it is 100.
