# Cloud Computing Intro

In simple terms, cloud computing means on-demand availability of various computing resources. Typical benefits of using the cloud include:

1. **Flexibility**  
   Choose the right **service model** (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), the right **deployment model** (public, private, hybrid) and the right resources without having to commit to a long-term contract (in most cases).
2. **Cost**  
   Being able to choose the right resources (of the right size) and to scale them as needed over time leads to a reduction in cost. Also, vendors seem to keep reducing their prices (some reasons: competition, cheaper parts, increased supply).
3. **Speed**  
   Spin up a web-server in a few minutes, with a few clicks, without having to call anyone or sign a contract.

Other benefits: global scale, security, performance, reliability and more. Check out the landing pages of [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/) and [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/overview/what-is-cloud-computing/).
