# Identity and Access Management (IAM)

This is the central service/place to manage everything related to access across all AWS services.
This is the first service you should interact with after creating a new AWS account.  
Your first account is called the **root** account. This is similar to Internet Explorer; you should use it only to create other 'accounts' (users). The main reason/concern is security of course - if someone gains access to your root account there is no quick way to stop him/her which could lead to considerable expenses.
