# Groups

Groups are what you probably expect to be - groups of users. The main benefit is that groups allow us to maintain permissions of multiple users (the members of a group). In the previous example about how your user was created, the administrator did not specify each permission individually (even though it is possible); he/she just assigned your user to the 'training' group from where your user inherited the permissions.  
There are no pre-defined groups. In our case, the admin created the 'training' group.
