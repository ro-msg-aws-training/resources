# DynamoDB

In short, DynamoDB is what most large platforms use (e.g. uber, tinder) due to its ability to scale. Use it when you need consistent performance even at huge scale (however, keep in mind to use distributed keys to avoid hot partitions).

There are already great resources to learn DynamoDB such as:

- [The DynamoDB Guide](https://www.dynamodbguide.com/key-concepts): concise explanations of most terms and approaches.
- [The AWS Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Introduction.html): excellent explanations, suggestions and [best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/best-practices.html).
- [_Amazon DynamoDB deep dive: Advanced design patterns_ video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6yqfmXiZTlM): **probably one of the most useful AWS videos**.
