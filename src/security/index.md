# Security

An important part of our duty is to ensure the security and confidentiality of the users' data. This is more crucial than ever given that we tend to do more and more things online (while providing more data) and that laws and regulations start to embrace the era that we live in.

Before we jump into the AWS services, remember that **systems must be secure by design**. This means that we cannot just design a system that performs the tasks that we want and hope to make it secure after. We must consider from the beginning aspects like authentication (who is the user), authorization (what the user can do), communication between various components (e.g. only our application should be able to access our database) and which data should be public and which must be private and accessible only to certain users.
